      <p>Given the youth of the Web, short product life cycles, and a "minimum viable product" mindset, there may seem little point to researching the history of online artifacts. But youth is not forever. As the Web matures, the low-hanging fruits are plucked, and <a target="tab" href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/18/app-abandoment-is-on-the-rise-as-consumers-stick-to-the-apps-they-know/">online consumption patterns ossify</a>—as historical material is created—there are insights and wisdom to be found in the many successes and failures that now notch the digital timeline. </p>

        <p>There are many objects we find in our homes and offices and, albeit in a slightly different form, on our computers—desktops, windows, bookmarks, folders, pens, scissors, paste, and pins. They are interface metaphors and old friends who help us feel at home in front of our computers. An interface metaphor  transposes the user’s conceptual model of the physical artifact to the digital one. The user’s experiences with and expectations of a physical artifact render an unfamiliar technology familiar. Metaphors have more than an a posteriori purpose of conferring familiarity upon the unfamiliar. Early modern computing presented a blank slate to technologists, and they used generative metaphors to conceive tools that could be shared and adopted with ease.</p>

        <p>The humble bulletin board, surfaced in cork, is one such metaphor. Bulletin boards are public media for impersonal communication often within a community. Any community member can view or post announcements, advertisements, and other messages. In the 70s and 80s, the bulletin board crossed the physical-digital divide as the bulletin board system, or BBS, to live in a mainframe and over ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet. The user could view and post to the BBS like they would to a physical one. Furthermore, a user could reply directly to a posting. Replies would be chronologically ordered into a thread of messages, archived, and made publicly viewable—a thread essentially is an asynchronous public conversation.</p>

        <p>In the 90s, the Internet matured and moved out of academic, government and military research installations and into civilian homes. No longer restricted to a relative handful of researchers, the Internet began to make inroads through global society. In 1990, there were 0.5 internet users per 100 people; by the end of the decade, that ratio increased to 6.77 users per 100 people. Commercial and personal web content proliferated. Web directories then search engines (AltaVista, Ask Jeeves, Google, Lycos, Yahoo) emerged to weave the digital deluge into a navigable world wide web. The information highways were laid and paved, and droves of pioneering Internet users sought out their new virtual homesteads and communities. BBSes matured and became the dominant web social spaces. They became known as “forums” and flourished. There were forums for expecting parents, avid gamers, hobbyists, cancer survivors, gearheads, and every other demographic, forming a constellation of niches that reflected the diversity and richness of our newly connected society.</p>

      <h3 class="article-header" id="l2-the-rise-of-news-aggregation">The Rise of News Aggregation</h3>
      <article class="half">

        <p>In 1994, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, was established with web technology standardization as its mission. In 1996, the W3C finalized the design of the eXtensible Markup Language, or XML, a schema for encoding data structures for portability between web applications. XML became the basis of standardized data exchange markup languages: molecular data, patient data, vector data, and other data types. Introduced in 1999, XML-based Rich Sivte Summary, or RSS, is a family of web feed formats for syndicating news articles and their metadata. Its success was not immediate, but its ubiquity was inevitable.</p>

        <p>At the turn of the millennium, the Web 2.0 movement was underway. Progressive developers rallied around web standards, accessibility, dynamic content, and scalability. Major blog platforms like WordPress, Blogger, and Xanga and news websites adopted RSS feeds to syndicate content. With news being syndicated in a standardized format, it became technically feasible to dynamically compose formerly disparate news streams into a single one. The capability to create personalized or curated newsfeeds became commercially available through RSS feed readers and non-social news aggregators.</p>

        <p>The Web 1.0 content ecosystem, excluding forums, was characterized by a one-directional flow of static content from webmasters to site visitors. The Web 2.0 movement, seeking to make content flow two-directional, adopted user participation as a core tenet and advocated the idea that users, instead of being passive content consumers, should be able to contribute comments, images, and videos to websites. Webpages would become not only dynamic but social, too.</p>

        <p>The rise of news aggregation, first enabled by the standardization of content syndication, and simultaneously that of the social web were to intersect inevitably. Their intersection resulted in the emergence of social news aggregators, which differ from their progenitors, non-social news aggregators, on content procurement. Non-social news aggregators stream and sometimes staff-curate content from multiple RSS feeds. In contrast, social news aggregators crowdsource their content: users submit, discuss, and collaboratively rank links to news articles, images, and videos.</p>

      <h3 class="article-header" id="l2-the-reign-of-digg">The Reign of Digg</h3>
      <article class="half">

        <p>Digg was launched in 2004 as a social news aggregation website. It became one of the most visited websites, receiving 29.1 million unique monthly visitors in January 2010, and once had a valuation of more than $160 million. (Walker 2012). Being linked to on the front page of Digg was a privilege coveted but dreaded: the torrent of visitors from Diggs could easily crash a web server. This phenomenon was coined the “Slashdot Effect”, but became known as the “Digg Effect” during Digg’s reign as the top news aggregator. At its height, Digg seemed indomitable as the kingmaker of websites. To borrow Ursula Le Guin’s words: its power seemed inescapable.</p>

        <p>But then, so did the divine right of kings. Within a single month in late 2010, Digg lost a third of its visitors and continued hemorrhaging. In July 2012, Digg sold for $500,000, a measly third of a single percent of its former valuation, to Betaworks, a New York City-based venture capital firm. Such a pronounced devaluation effectively was a public obituary: Digg, 7, passed away on Thursday, July 12th, 2012. What happened? What went rotten in the state of Digg-mark?</p>

        <p>The relevancy of Digg began a slow decline in late 2007. In a gambit to refresh its format and rebuild relevancy, Digg launched its controversial “v4” update in 2010. The update introduced fundamental changes to the website. And the changes it brought were sweeping. Prior to v4, users could selectively collapse branches of the comment thread, which was loaded fully expanded, to make it more readable and navigable. The v4 update made replies to top-level comments collapsed by default, inadvertently suppressing discussion because, for casual visitors who skim through comments, top-level comments get the first and last word on any matter.</p>

        <p>The model, in the Digg team’s estimation, was insufficient. To create a new model, Digg combined the social and nonsocial news aggregation models so that content is sourced from both crowds and publisher web syndication channels. Official publisher profiles were introduced for media companies, brands, and other organizations so they could automatically submit content directly from their RSS feeds. Although directly submitted articles were not pushed to the front page, they were prioritized for users who followed the publisher profiles. Publisher-submitted articles, ballooned by the significant momentum of upvotes by following users, often ended up featured among top stories. Many users were upset by the overwhelming intrusion of mainstream publisher and branded content into their newsfeeds. Furthermore, they were disarmed from lashing back. In v4, the downvote, or “bury”, in Digg site jargon, feature was disabled, and discontent users were left unable to downvote offending content into oblivion.</p>

        <p>With publisher direct content, Digg began to move toward aggregation of mainstream news, a territory fraught with rising powers like Facebook and Twitter. (Metz 2012). Facebook launched Pages on November 7th, 2007. With Pages, publishers can post articles and links that will appear on the newsfeeds of their followers. Like official Digg profiles, Facebook Pages gave publishers a direct channel to submit content instead of relying on users to share content from the publishers’ websites.</p>

      <h3 class="article-header" id="l2-the-rise-of-reddit">The Rise of Reddit</h3>
      <article class="half">

        <p>Incubated by Y Combinator, Reddit was founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, and the site quickly found attention. A year and a half later, it was purchased by Condé Nast for between $10 million to $20 million. (Inc) Despite its remarkable success as a young site, for years Reddit was overshadowed by the then-dominant news aggregator Digg. In late 2010, Reddit’s breakthrough came in the form of the Digg v4 update that caused Digg users to revolt and defect en masse to Reddit and other social news aggregation sites. The fortune of Reddit was swiftly purchased with the misfortune of Digg. Today, Reddit is one of the world’s most visited websites.</p>

        <p>The Reddit model is a hybrid of the social news aggregation and forum models, accommodating both news and non-news content. The website is a loose confederation of subreddits, each of which is functionally a forum where users can submit and comment on links to news, images, videos, and other web pages, and, unlike on a social news aggregator, text posts. Although the ability for users to submit text posts may seem an insignificant feature, it greatly expands the possibilities of subreddits beyond being mere topic containers.</p>

        <p>Being content-versatile, user-created and user-moderated, and thus user-purposed, subreddits form a diverse virtual landscape. According to redditmetrics.com, there are 959,482 subreddits covering dedicated topics from VR physics to Pokemon Go.</p>

        <p>The decentralized democratic Reddit model enabled the website to expand rapidly. Users, without need for authorization by the Reddit team, can conquer new content territory as they see fit. If there’s no subreddit dedicated to discussion about blind archery, then one can be created. Since subreddits are user-created, user-moderated, and thus user-purposed, they can be malicious.</p>

      <p>Subreddit /r/redditdata conducted a <a href="#survey" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="survey-ref">survey in March 2015</a> that received 16,817 responses from users across 100 different subreddits and 175 different countries.</p>

      <p>While content on Reddit is great, its community doesn’t measure up: 86% of respondents were satisfied with the site content, but only 67% were satisfied with the community while 13% were dissatisfied.</p>

      <p>The community doesn’t measure up for female users: female respondents were twice as likely as male respondents to be dissatisfied with the Reddit community (20% vs. 12%).</p>

      <p>Respondents expressed “concern about an increasingly negative and unsafe community environment.” Out of the respondents who wouldn’t recommend Reddit, 50% “cited hateful or offensive content as the reason why.”</p>

      <h3 class="article-header">Trolling</h3>
      <article class="half">

          <p>The contemporary use of the term “trolling” originated in the late 1980s from Usenet where it denoted a user who intentionally disrupts online communities. But trolling is no longer confined to obscure message boards. It has entered into the cultural mainstream and Reddit. Its use has since expanded to cover many types of virtual mischief and malice and become an increasingly nebulous term to pin down. Judith Donath, founder of the Social Media Group at the MIT Media Lab, <a href="#donath" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="donath-ref">defines trolling succinctly:</a></p>

          <blockquote class="lh-copy measure dark-blue">"Trolling is a game about identity deception, albeit one that is played without the consent of most of the players. The troll attempts to pass as a legitimate participant, sharing the group's common interests and concerns; the newsgroup members, if they are cognizant of trolls and other identity deceptions, attempt to both distinguish real from trolling postings and, upon judging a poster to be a troll, make the offending poster leave the group. Their success at the former depends on how well they - and the troll - understand identity cues; their success at the latter depends on whether the troll's enjoyment is sufficiently diminished or outweighed by the costs imposed by the group." </blockquote>

          <p>From the perspective of the virtual community-building enterprise Reddit, trolling harms the cohesion and mutual trust of its communities and, by extension, its brand. At its core, trolling is an antisocial behavior.</p>

At its core, trolling is an antisocial behavior.On the University of Illinois subreddit, /r/UIUC, people often post about poor experiences with a shuttle service called Suburban Express. Its owner, Dennis Toeppen, earned notoriety for his Reddit trolling. He used throwaway accounts to troll users who complain about his company or to astroturf support. However, his efforts yield little success because his attempts are quickly detected and called out by the community. His accounts have telltale characteristics: lack of deep comment history neither in the /r/UIUC subreddit nor the broader Reddit community, any comments are posted to Suburban Express-related threads, and those comments are universally antagonistic.</p>

      <h3 class="article-header">Facebook</h3>
      <article class="half">
        <p>Facebook Groups are forums where users can post, read, and discuss topics that are important to them.</p>

        <p>A post shows little information about the posting user.</p>
        <ul class="lh-copy">
          <li>The status of the reader’s friendship, if it exists, and the posting user, is not shown. The reader usually will recognize if the posting user is a friend or not. A reader who has a large network (1000+ Facebook friends) may lose track.</li>
          <li>Number of Likes received by the post. The names of notable users and select friends are shown.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Hovering the cursor over a user’s name triggers the display of a profile card. The card provides select information about who the user is:</p>

        <ul class="lh-copy">
          <li>Enlarged profile photo and cover photo</li>
          <li>Education, workplace, or recent activity</li>
          <li>Mutual friends, if any</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additional information is embedded in interaction buttons:</p>
        <ul class="lh-copy">
          <li>Option to add the user as a friend or, if the reader and the user are already friends, the option to modify their friendship.</li>
          <li>Option to follow the user or, if the reader is already following the user, the option to change how they follow the user.Does the reader wants to see more posts from this user? Fewer?</li>
          <li>Option to directly message the user.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The precedence of users before content is evident on Facebook. It’s more important who a posting user is than what is being posted because the reader’s relationship with the user provides rich context for that content. A wedding photo on a reader’s news feed is more than a photo of a (hopefully) happy couple; it is embedded with memories, history, and other relationships. </p>

      <h3 class="article-header">Xbox Live Gamer Rep</h3>
      <article class="half">
        <p>Xbox Live is one of the largest online multiplayer gaming and digital content distribution platform in the world, along with PlayStation Network and Valve Steam. In 2014, user reputations were introduced. The more hours a player plays online without receiving negative feedback from other players, the better their reputation will be.</p>

        <p>There are three reputation tiers corresponding with different privilege sets.</p>

        <ul class="lh-copy">    
          <li>Good – Most players rest in the “good” tier. Players in this tier retain full privileges and will intermittently receive rewards for continued good behavior.</li>
          <li>Needs work – Some players will fall into the “needs work” tier after receiving sufficient negative feedback. This tier serves to remind players about the impact of their behavior on the community and encourages them to rectify their future behavior.</li>
          <li>Avoid me – Players will fall into “avoid me” tier if they were already in the “needs work” tier and continued to exhibit antisocial (not asocial) behavior in multiplayer games. At this tier, the system automatically metes out appropriate penalties.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Xbox Live reputation system is designed to make qualitative judgments on players’ reputations. Its transferability to Reddit is questionable. There are fewer dimensions for behavior in multiplayer games than in forum discussions: players are working together to accomplish team objectives, rarely discussing politics or other sensitive ideas. Bad sportsmanship, unwillingness to cooperate, and abandonment of one’s own team are inarguably undesirous elements in multiplayer gaming and thus are grounds for negative feedback and consequent reputation demotion by the Xbox Live system.</p>

        <p>On Reddit, a user gives feedback to another user by up or down-voting their comment. The feedback may be motivated by the other user’s ideas, language, affiliation, or along some other dimension of the user’s character. Ideological disagreement is subject to negative feedback through downvotes but is not grounds for a system-wide reputation demotion because what may be ideologically unacceptable in one community may be acceptable in a different community. Reddit is a diverse super-community of many communities of all interests and political persuasions.</p>

        <p>Given the complex and highly relational nature of reputation in a pluralistic community, I concluded that a simple qualitative reputation judgment system is not only unsuitable to Reddit but also antithetical to its values.</p>
