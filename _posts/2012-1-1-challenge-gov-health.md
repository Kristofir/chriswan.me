        <p class="xp1">Challenge.gov's Healthcare Record Design Challenged charged us with reconsidering the following: How might we design a more accessible healthcare record? In a two day sprint, our team designed a winning entry that approached healthcare history as a narrative.</p>

        <p class="xp1"> Our final prototype emphasized the cause and effect that healthcare has on our daily lives. Details with an impact include color-coding visits (planned checkups versus unexpected emergencies), plain language explanations, and a dead simple medication section that nabbed us a 3rd place medal.</p>
