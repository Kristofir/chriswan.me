Colorful icons on the left-hand side tell you the kind of business a receipt is from. Summary costs on the right-hand side help you quickly identify receipts for significant purchases. Refine your search by typing in a business name or an item article’s name, or specifying the kind of business or the receipt’s general time period.</p>
