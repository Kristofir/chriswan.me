      <h2 class="subsection-headline">Introduction</h2>
      <p>The design project was motivated by my frustration over my disorganized receipts. Many laid in piles or folders. Others hid in my emails or text messages. In an era of smartphones, the balkanized state of receipts seemed overdue for modernization.</p>

      <p>The research and design project phases were not monolithic and did not happen in perfect sequence. I weaved between them as research yielded new answers and design raised new questions.</p>

      <img class="diagram" src="../images/receipts/diagram-rd-process.png" />

      <p>Any realistic solution must inhabit the complex point-of-sale technology ecosystem, while any worthwhile solution must serve the user’s needs. I was designing an app not so much for receipts as for customers and businesses at the end of the day. Understanding that any solution would not stand alone in the context of customers’ lives or business activities, I chose to approach my research through an ecological perspective.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection flex-auto" style="max-width: 700px;">
      <h2 class="subsection-headline">User Research</h2>

      <p>I started by interviewing a dozen individuals. From these interviews, I learned several key insights that I have summarized below.</p>

      <p><strong>People develop their own unique ways of organizing receipts.</strong> Several interviewees reported that they would tape receipts to the original boxes of appliances, electronics, and other significant purchases. Some would file away important receipts and discard unimportant ones. Others did not take a disciplined approach, indiscriminately stashing receipts in kitchen drawers or letting receipts pile up in their wallets or purses.</p>

      <img class="diagram" src="../images/receipts/diagram-organization-methods.png" />

      <p><strong>Consequently, people have their own unique ways of finding receipts.</strong> Interviewees reported difficulty finding receipts when they mix receipt storage strategies. "Did I put the receipt in the kitchen drawer? In the box? In my bag upstairs? I can't remember exactly."</p>

      <p><strong>People aren't uniformly organized or disorganized.</strong> Their best efforts to organize can succumb to shortage of time or energy, resulting in mixed receipt ad hoc storage strategies.</p>

      <p><strong>People remember few details or features about their receipts.</strong> Human memory is fragile, fallible, and suggestible. The more distant a memory, the more muddled it becomes. "Where did I put that receipt for the ladder from Home Depot? Or was it Lowe's?"</p>

      <p><strong>Receipts can hold sentimental value when they're associated with a significant memory.</strong> Several interviewees reported having kept old receipts from a memorable date night or trip. A few reported having shared funny, outrageous, or otherwise interesting receipts on social media.</p>

      <p>
      My takeaways:
      <ul>
        <li>Because people develop their own unique ways of organizing receipts, the design solution should provide organizational flexibility to users so they can organize however they will!</li>
        <li>Because people have their own unique ways of finding receipts, the design solution should have many different ways to search for a specific receipt. All roads lead to Rome—er, no, that one receipt!</li>
        <li>Because people aren't uniformly organized or disorganized, the design solution should make it always easy for users maintain a good organizational baseline!</li>
        <li>Because people remember few details or features about their receipts, the design solution should support users to effectively search with incomplete or partially incorrect information!</li>
        <li>Because receipts can hold sentimental value when they're associated with a significant memory, the design solution should be mindful about what a receipt can signify and be open-minded about what users want to do with their own receipts!</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="subsection-headline">Business Research</h2>
      <p>Electronic point of sale, or POS, systems originated in the 1970s and have undergone tremendous development and changed since then. Today, they are divided in two categories: traditional and cloud-based.</p>

      <p><strong>Traditional POS systems</strong> comprise of equipment often from different manufacturers: cash drawers, scanners, receipt printers, cashier-facing and customer-facing POS terminal displays, and payment terminals are interoperable because they share manufacturer-neutral APIs. Connected to switch networks, POS systems back up transaction information to store or company servers. Whether or not a traditional POS system supports newer payment methods like NFC is determined by its payment terminal.</p>

      <p><strong>Cloud-based systems</strong> were introduced in the 2000s, following the expansion of web services and the growing availability of affordable mobile devices. Cloud-based systems support all old and most newer payment methods. All systems offer receipts in both old and new formats. Cloud-based systems are connected to web services and receipts are hosted and made accessible online to customers. Companies like Square and Clover market and sell complete POS systems like the one pictured above.</p>

      <p>The National Retail Federation, or NRF, a merchant consortium, established as a division the Association for Retail Technology Standards, or ARTS. The ARTS established in the late 1990s manufacturer-neutral APIs and XML schemas that enable POS peripherals by different manufacturers to work together as a coherent system. IXRetail, established by the ARTS in the early 2000s, provides an XML schema for electronic receipts.</p>

      <p>At the end of 2015, the NRF reported in its <a href="https://nrf.com/sites/default/files/Images/Media%20Center/NRF%20Retail%20Return%20Fraud%20Final_0.pdf" target="blank">2015 Return Fraud Survey</a> that "fraudulent e-receipted returns" had increased by 86% over the last year, representing the top growth area for return fraud. The shortfalls of current electronic receipts are non-exhaustively enumerated in <a href="https://nrf.com/news/the-dark-side-of-e-receipts" target="blank">an NRF publication</a>: they "are easy to transmit, easy to alter, susceptible to cloning and forgery and hard to permanently delete once saved to storage media."</p>

      <h2 class="subsection-headline">A Better Receipt</h2>
      <p>I used traditional paper receipt as a starting point for digital receipt design. A receipt is composed of several critical components:
      <ul>
        <li>Business information: name, contact, location</li>
        <li>Item information: item names, details, prices</li>
        <li>Transaction information: payment method, transaction date</li>
        <li>Miscellaneous information: return policy, customer feedback, warranty guarantees</li>
      </ul></p>

      <h2 class="subsection-headline">Oh, The Places You'll Go</h2>
      <p>Everyday, millions of people use Apple Maps to get directions and find destinations. It's the most popular map app on iOS, <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/06/16/apple-google-maps-ios/" target="blank">having far surpassed Google Maps in 2015</a>.</p>

      <p>Apple Maps has its own bold and colorful language of place markers that identify types of businesses and attractions. I reasoned that, given Apple Maps' popularity, many iOS users have developed a basic familiarity of Apple Maps iconography: such basic familiarity is a user mental model resource.</p>

      <p>Thinking ecologically, I recognized there's potential for a symbiotic relationship between Receipts and Maps. Receipts could leverage user familiarity with Maps iconography and, in turn, build on it. Over time, the symbiosis will strengthen users' mental associations between place types, place pictograms, and place colors.</p>

      <img class="diagram" src="../images/receipts/diagram-symbiosis-maps-receipts.png" />

      <p>A place icon can graphically imbue a digital receipt with a sense of where it's from. Users can search receipts not only by business name and location but also by place icon and color. As users' mental models strengthen through repeated use of Receipts and Maps, users will identify place icons and colors more quickly and reliably in both apps, thereby becoming becoming more effective at using the apps.</p>
