        <p>I created a set of diagrams for a friend's concept design for a flexible, programmable indoor-outdoor space for community events.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the diagrams is to artistically communicate the diversity of community-supporting activities that can take place in the space and their dynamic with climatic and community conditions that change through the year.</p>
        <p>The rings allude to the circular nature of time and elliptical form of the design structure.</p>

        <p>The activity rings begin to pull apart, gently revealing distinctive patterns...</p>

        <p>The rings are fully separated. Activities are segregated between rings by their type. We can see how warm weather coincides with the farmers' market and children's summer vacation activities schedule.</p>

        <p>I worked mainly in Rhinoceros 3D, which gave me precise control over angles and dimensions and advanced topological tools that aren't available in conventional graphics programs.</p>
        <p>Monthly average daily temperature highs and lows were plotted by height on two concentric rings. Intermediary data points were interpolated. </p>
