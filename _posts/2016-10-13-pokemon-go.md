Originally conceived in 1995 by Satoshi Tajiri, the Pokemon media franchise empire today encompasses anime (Japanese-style animation) for film and television, manga (Japanese-style comics), trading cards, and video games—the franchise’s crown jewels. The franchise’s first generation video game launched in Japan as Pocket Monsters: Red and Green in 1996, later that year followed by Pocket Monsters: Blue. Two years later, in 1998, the game was introduced to North American audiences in a somewhat abbreviated form, Pokémon: Red and Blue, and touched off the original Pokemon “craze” as described by IGN cofounder Craig Harris in a 1999 game review. The rise of Pokémon coincided with the childhoods of millennials, many of whom remember—fondly—of game cartridges strewn across beds, fumbling for cables to link up GameBoys, and trading Pokémon with other children on shaky morning bus rides.

In 2012, Niantic Labs, then an internal startup within Google, launched Ingress, a location-based, augmented-reality (AR), massively multiplayer online mobile game where players are organized into two opposing factions vying for virtual control over physical landmarks. The game achieved moderate albeit niche success, particularly among technologically-savvy, urban American men. Nonetheless, Ingress cultivated a strong player community and produced the solid location-based, AR game formula on which the fundamental gameplay mechanics of Pokemon Go were based.

Niantic, Inc., spun off from Google in 2015, launched Pokemon Go, after several months of closed beta, on July 6th, 2016. The game received immediate global attention and achieved near-linear growth well into mid-July. Each passing day saw the game’s active player base grow by millions with no end seemingly within sight. Soon Niantic found itself in the coveted but volatile situation of being a victim of one’s own success: player growth exceeded their wildest dreams—and preparations. The collective weight of 40-million-some active players proved to be a burden too heavy to shoulder by the game servers. As consequence of the game servers being overtaxed, the game experience suffered: excruciatingly long login times and game unresponsiveness prompted player outcry. Niantic, already engaged in a mad-dash effort to expand game server capacity, sought to lighten game server loads by disabling server processing-intensive features.

By the end of July, the very month during which the game launched, the game’s maturity became apparent as its active player base had tapered off since its peak in mid-July. Through August and September, the active player base continued to wither, albeit not as rapidly as it had grown, but nonetheless withered as hundreds of thousands of players became inactive each day.

Not long ago, players would swarm Central Park in New York City or halfway across the world in Beitou in Taipei City for a rare Pokemon. What happened? Why has the game so abruptly lost its luster? Is this the game’s inevitable natural end of life? Or did the removal of a few certain features adversely affect the game experience? My upcoming project seeks to investigate the forces driving the game’s decline and then propose remedial design changes.
