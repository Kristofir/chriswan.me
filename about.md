      <p class="about-me">My name is Christopher Wan, and I am a designer.</p>

      <p>I studied architecture and human-computer interaction and led a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/design-for-america">student organization</a> to advocate human-centered design at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As a student, I worked across architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, behavioral design, and interface design, seeing them as interconnected, not disparate, disciplines.</p>

      <p>Design is a profession as well as a practice of material philosophy. Designing something—however modest or grand—makes a statement about how the world should be. But I believe that good design can both serve the common good and be good business: the best do both.</p>

      <p>I have a wide yet deep technical skillset for working across all design phases. I am proficient with 2D and 3D design software like Sketch, Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, AutoCAD, Rhinoceros 3D, and SketchUp. I can also work with motion and interaction software like Framer, Principle, Origami Studio, and InVision. Not only can I design and prototype ideas, I can implement them using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and frameworks.</p>

      <p>Currently, I'm looking for work and my next adventure.</p>
