      <p class="f3 fw4 lh-copy mb4 dark-red">I am Chris Wan. I recently graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I studied architecture and human-computer interaction. Currently, I'm looking for work and my next adventure.</p>

      <p class="black f4 fw3 lh-copy mb4">My passion for design is rooted in an upbringing spent between continents and cities that fostered a fascination of how people shape and are shaped in turn by their environments â€” natural or artificial, physical or virtual. I strongly believe that design at its core is about the human condition and contriving ways to improve it.</p>
