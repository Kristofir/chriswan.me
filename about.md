      <p>I am Chris Wan. I recently graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I studied architecture and human-computer interaction. Currently, I'm looking for work and my next adventure.</p>

      <p>My passion for design is rooted in an upbringing spent between continents and cities that fostered a fascination of how people shape and are shaped in turn by their environments â€” natural or artificial, physical or virtual. I strongly believe that design at its core is about the human condition and contriving ways to improve it.</p>

      <p>In university, I developed a broad multidisciplinary design skillset that allows me to work across the design spectrum. I became studio lead for Design For America and promoted human-centered design on campus.</p>
